### File Structure

1. **Browser Compatibility Files:**

   - `src/styles/browser-compatibility.css`: Core fallbacks for CSS variables and modern properties
   - `src/utils/browser-detector.js`: Detection logic for applying browser-specific fixes
   - `src/utils/ie-polyfills.js`: Specific fixes for Internet Explorer

2. **Updated Component Files:**
   - `src/components/ui/Button.css`: Enhanced with vendor prefixes and fallbacks
   - `src/components/ui/InputField.css`: Updated with compatibility fixes
   - `src/components/ui/GradientBackground.css`: Modified with simpler alternatives for older browsers
   - `src/styles/index.css`: Updated with browser compatibility imports and overrides

## Testing Guide

To ensure cross-browser compatibility, test the application in the following environments:

1. **Chrome on Windows 7**

   - Test all form interactions
   - Verify gradient background displays properly or falls back gracefully
   - Check button hover and focus states

2. **Internet Explorer 11**

   - Verify page layout appears correctly
   - Test form validation and submission
   - Check that animations either work or gracefully degrade

3. **Older Chrome Versions (Below 50)**
   - Test CSS variable usage
   - Verify flexbox layouts
   - Check transitions and animations

## Additional Notes

- Some modern visual effects like complex gradients and filter blurs will appear simplified in older browsers
- Performance optimizations have been applied specifically for Windows 7/older Chrome
- The application should maintain full functionality across all supported browsers, even if visual appearances differ slightly
